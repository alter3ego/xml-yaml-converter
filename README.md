A console Java application that reads the XML file sample.xml and
creates an object structure based on it, after which it dumps the object structure into 
the YAML file output.yml.

The output.yml file is generated as a result of the program operation,
containing data identical to the data in the sample.xml file,
but in YAML format and without the Company.EmplProfile element.
